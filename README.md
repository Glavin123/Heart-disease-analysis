# 🫀 Heart Disease Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing heart disease survival trends using **Excel for data cleaning** and **Power BI for visualization**.
Key health indicators like survival rate, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and the effects of smoking, diabetes, and high blood pressure were examined through interactive dashboards.

## 📊 Project Type

**Excel (Data Cleaning) + Power BI (Visualization)**

---

## 📝 Description

The project uses an Excel dataset to clean and prepare data for analysis in Power BI.
Several **DAX measures and calculated fields** were created to derive key performance indicators (KPIs), including:

* **Survival Rate**
* **Average Age of Survival**
* **Total Survival Count**
* **Total Death Count**

Additional visual insights were developed for:

* **Survival Count and Average Serum Creatinine by Age Group**
* **Survival Count and Average Ejection Fraction by Age Group**
* **Survival Rate by Age Group**
* **Impact of Smoking, High Blood Pressure, Anaemia, and Diabetes by Age Group**

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning and preprocessing
* **Microsoft Power BI** – Dashboard creation and DAX-based analysis

---

## 📂 Dataset

**Name:** `heart_disease_dataset.xlsx`
**Source:** Internal / self-collected dataset
**Contents:** Includes patient demographics, survival status, age groups, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and comorbidity indicators.

---

## 🎯 Output / Key Results

The dashboard highlights:

* **Survival Rate:** 67.89%
* **Average Age of Survival:** 58.76 years
* **Key KPIs:** Trends in serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and disease factors across age groups.

The visualization helps in identifying age groups with higher survival probabilities and understanding how comorbidities impact heart disease outcomes.
